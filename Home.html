            <h1 id="head1">What is health?</h1>
            <p id="para1">In our life health is more important than anything. As like our ancistors told that <q>Health is wealth</q><br>
            So keeping our health is most needed thing. Health has different types <br><br><b>Physical Health</b>
        <br><br>
        A person who has good physical health is likely to have bodily functions and processes working at their peak.

        This is not only due not only to an absence of disease. Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, 
        and adequate rest all contribute to good health. People receive medical treatment to maintain the balance, when necessary.
        
        Physical well-being involves pursuing a healthful lifestyle to decrease the risk of disease. 
        Maintaining physical fitness, for example, can protect and develop the endurance of a person’s breathing and 
        heart function, muscular strength, flexibility, and body composition.
        
        Looking after physical health and well-being also involves reducing the risk of an injury or health issue.
        
        minimizing hazards in the workplace practicing effective hygiene
        avoiding the use of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs
        taking the recommended vaccines for a specific condition or country when traveling
        Good physical health can work in tandem with mental health to improve a person’s overall quality of life.
        <br>
        <br><b>Mental Health</b><br><br>
        It is harder to define mental health than physical health because many psychological diagnoses depend on an 
        individual’s perception of their experience.

        With improvements in testing, however, doctors are now able to identify some physical signs of some types of mental 
        illness in CT scans and genetic tests.
        
        Good mental health is not only categorized by the absence of depression, anxiety, or another disorder. 
        It also depends on a person’s ability to:
        
        enjoy life
        bounce back after difficult experiences and adapt to adversity
        balance different elements of life, such as family and finances
        feel safe and secure
        achieve their full potential
